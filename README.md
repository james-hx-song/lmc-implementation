## Introduction
This project reimplements some of the methods of the paper ["Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05671) by Frankle et al (2020). Frankle et al. studies whether networks converge to the same, linearly connected minimum under different batch samples of SGD noise via instability analysis  I would like to investigate whether linear mode connectivity exist in architectures such as LeNet and ResNet on datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR and replicate the results from the paper. Additionally, I aim to extend the research by investigating whether linear mode connectivity exists in transformers, specifically decoder-only transformers.
