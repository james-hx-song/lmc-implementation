## Introduction
This project is a reimplementation of the paper "Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis". The goal of this project is to replicate the results from the paper, investigating whether linear mode connectivity exist in architectures such as LeNet and ResNet on datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR. Additionally, we aim to extend the research by investigating whether linear mode connectivity exists in transformers, specifically decoder-only transformers.
